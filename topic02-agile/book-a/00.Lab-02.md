# Objectives

This lab will reinforce some concepts from the talk and prepare you for taking a specification and breaking it into User Stories and small tasks to help you realise them. It will emphasise the importance of small tasks with a view to the overall quality of the solution and will give you a glimpse into how a college assignment can be treated as a real world industry project.
